# Poly-Graph-Plotter
Graph plotter of Polynomial functions
**language:** python3

Requires **matplotlib** [download here](http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)
```
For y= a0.x^0 + a1.x^1 + a2.x^2 + ..... + aN.x^N
We input a polynomial function as:
a0,a1,a2,a3,.....,aN

For example,
If we want a graph of y= x^3 + 4x^2 + 5
we feed in the values:
5,0,4,1
then input the lower and the upper limits (range of x)
Then click on Plot to generate the plot
```

Currently, the GUI requires a lot of improvement and if possible we can change the input method from the above mentioned to:
`a.x^b + c.x^d +...... + z`
